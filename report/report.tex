% \subsection{Introduction of the \KeY tool}

\KeY~\cite{KeYBook2} is a deductive program verification engine to
show the conformance of Java Programs to their specification in the
Java Modeling Language (JML). It supports sequential Java 1.4 and the
full JavaCard~3.0 standard.
%
The deductive engine of \KeY is based on a sequent calculus for a
dynamic logic for Java and supports both interactive and automatised
verification.
% and provides a sound and (relative) complete reasoning
% on Java programs. This reasoning requires that user-defined formal
% specification written in Java Modeling Language~\cite{Jml}.


\section{Verification of the Subject}
The verification target of the challenge is the HAGRID key server, a
new implementation of the PGP key server written in Rust that makes
the key server conform to data protection regulations and increases
resilience against denial of service attacks.

Since \KeY operates on programs written in Java, it cannot directly be
used to verify HAGRID's Rust source code. Hence, a simplified
re-implementation of the of the core functionality of the HAGRID key
server in Java had to be written.
%
We came up with two different Java implementations of different
complexity.
%
Both adhere to the natural language specifications in~\cite{ltcDescr}
%
The first version implements a single class that only
makes use of primitive data types and arrays. The second version
modularizes the first version and uses an implementation of a map data
structure. Both versions are abstractions of HAGRID's implementation
and actual behaviour. We focus on the database logic and leave network
connection, and en- and de-coding of HTTP messages aside for this
project. %\todo{iterative approach. MU: I did not understand that.}
%
Moreover, in the implementation, we assume that e-mail addresses and
keys are ``atomic'' in the sense that they are used as keys and values
in the database, but are never analysed for their contents. In
particular, we avoid the use of objects for the data and represent
them by primitive integer values.
%
This is of course a severe simplification, but since strings are
objects in the Java programming language, they produce significantly
more difficult verification conditions due to additional heap framing
conditions which need to be shown.

We were able to specify and verify both implementations successfully.

\paragraph{A simple email-key map.}
%
The first version bases upon five integer arrays.
These arrays store:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item the email (identification) of the user
  \item one array for confirmed and one array for unconfirmed keys
  \item an array that stores confirmation codes, and
  \item an array that stores which operation was most recently requested.
\end{itemize}
%
The maximum number of users is fixed to 1024, as the arrays are never resized.
The implementation only allows to confirm last requested action, e.g. if a
deletion is requested, a pending addition is abandoned.
%
We avoid the use of any objects to avoid dealing with a changes of the heap,
resulting in a version that is verifiable without interactions in KeY. 
Table~\ref{fig:numbers} shows the aggregated metrics of the proofs.

We also attempted to add a `time-out' mechanism, to cover the following aspect of
the challenge:
\begin{quote}
  If the provided code \emph{is one recently issued}, then the corresponding
  operation (addition/removal) is finalised.
\end{quote}
This is easy to add in the implementation: first store the time that
the user requests the operation (in an additional array), and when
confirming, only approve the operation if that time was sufficiently
recent. But it is problematic for specification and verification: the
time limit may not yet have elapsed when the precondition (i.e. the
specification) is evaluated, but it may have when the JVM determines
the current time in the \verb|confirm| method body. So we dropped the
time-out aspect.

\paragraph{The map-based approach.}

  \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{uml}
  \caption{UML class diagram of the Map version}
  \label{fig:umlclassdiagram}
\end{figure}
%
The second version follows the same design principles as the first
one, but aims to achieve a more object-oriented, modular
architecture.  To this end, the key server now contains four map data
structures for the stored keys, pending additions and pending
deletions.

Fig.~\ref{fig:umlclassdiagram} gives an overview of the class layout.
%
The interface \texttt{KIMap} (Key Integer Map) represents a map of
from \texttt{int} to \texttt{int}. Its functionality is specified (by
JML contracts) using the abstract map theory built into
\KeY. \texttt{KIMapImpl} is a simple implementation based upon two
\emph{int}-arrays (one for the keys and one for the values).
%
\texttt{KeyServer} is the verifying key server
% using integers as e-mail addresses and keys
providing the functionality to answer queries for keys, to process
requests for key addition and deletion and to perform these
mutation operations upon confirmation. It is specified using a
number of model fields containing (finite) logical maps.
%
% In contrast to the first version, an operation on an entry is not superseded by
% a new manipulation request. The last confirmed operation wins. Also, a previous
% requested deletion for an email-key pair $(e,k)$ can be used delete a different
% pair $(e,k')$ if there was a confirmed update for the key $k$ in between the
% deletion request and its confirmation.

\section{Verification Results}

We were able to verify strong functional method contracts for all
methods of the implementations. This includes verifying that requested
operations are confirmed by the right confirmation code,
absence of runtime
exceptions and a guaranteed termination of each request handler.

% We verified the software on a method-by-method.
% %
% This includes
% %
% This exclude the effect of multiple chained operations. \todo{MU: DId not understand}

We noticed during the verification of the modular map approach that
discharging the framing conditions brought the \KeY on the edge of its
capabilities. In the following, we devised a new technique to deal
with framing conditions that combines dynamic frames with aspects from
ownership. This allowed us to close all proofs successfully.


Both implementations used integers instead of Strings as an
simplifying abstraction.
%
The obvious next goal is the verification of an implementation which
uses \texttt{String} values for e-mails and keys.
%
%During the verification with \KeY we found some deficiencies in \KeY.
